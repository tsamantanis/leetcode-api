# Introduction

This unofficial Leetcode API helps developers easily access Leetcode technical interview question data to assist interview preparation.  

## API Reference

The unofficial Leetcode API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_%28HTTP%29#Use_for_submitting_web_forms) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
